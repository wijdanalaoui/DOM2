This is an overall description on what I created:

The HTML file sets up a simple webpage with a heading, a colored box, and a button.
The CSS file contains basic styling for the elements.
The JavaScript file defines functionality for changing the color of the box when the button is clicked.
The getRandomColor() function generates a random hexadecimal color code.
When the button is clicked, the getRandomColor() function is called, and the background color of the box (colorBox) is changed to the generated color.
